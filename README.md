Geometry Friends Study

C# code to run for the geometry friends human-ai collaboration study.

What do humans think and expect of themselves, the AI partner, and the team in a human-AI collaboration setting? To address this, we will conduct an in-person study using Geometry Friends, a two-player cooperative physics-based game in which subjects will play with agents presenting different levels of initiative (leader or follower) and willingness to shift initiave.
