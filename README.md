# Geometry Friends Study

<i>What do humans think and expect of themselves, the AI partner, and the team in a human-AI collaboration setting?</i>

To address this, we will conduct an in-person study using Geometry Friends, a two-player cooperative physics-based game in which subjects will play with agents presenting different levels of initiative (leader or follower) and willingness to shift initiave.

The three conditions of the study are:
- follower without shift - the agent will always follow the human playerâ€™s plan, never taking the initiative,
- leader without shift - the agent will always act as a leader, following its own plan,
- adaptive behaviour - the agent starts as a leader but if the human does not follow, it will give them initiative after a while.

For all conditions, the agent will play as the circle character of the game, while the human will play as the rectangle.
