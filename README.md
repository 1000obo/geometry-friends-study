# Geometry Friends Study

<i>What do humans think and expect of themselves, the AI partner, and the team in a human-AI collaboration setting?</i>

To address this, we will conduct an in-person study using Geometry Friends, a two-player cooperative physics-based game in which subjects will play with agents presenting different levels of initiative (leader or follower) and willingness to shift initiave.

The three conditions of the study are:
- follower without shift - the agent will always follow the human playerâ€™s plan, never taking the initiative,
- leader without shift - the agent will always act as a leader, following its own plan,
- adaptive behaviour - the agent starts as a leader but if the human does not follow, it will give them initiative after a while.

For all conditions, the agent will play as the circle character of the game, while the human will play as the rectangle.

## Form
Participants will fill this form: https://form.jotform.com/230637216685359
## Downloading the Project
To download the project, simply clone the repository or download the project ZIP file.

## Running the Game
To run the game, follow these steps:
1. Enter the exe folder
2. Inside the folder, you may need to unlock the files in the Agents folder to run the agents.
3. Run the game executable, GeometryFriends.exe, and connect the game controller.
4. In the game options, select the "human + circle AI" option in single player mode.
5. Choose the desired agents implementation: `L` for leader, `F` for follower, or `S` for the agent that shifts initiative between leader and follower. There are 6 different order options: 
   * L, F, S
   * L, S, F
   * F, L, S
   * F, S, L
   * S, F, L
   * S, L, F
6. To start playing, simply click the "play!" button.
   * For the training part, players will play the training levels. 
   * For the first agent, they will play the first level set for 5 minutes.
   * For the second agent, they will play the second level set.
   * For the third agent, they will play the third level set. The level sets are balanced and introduce the same game challenges.

## Log Files
You can find the generated log files of the experiment, including screen recordings and game logs, in the logs folder of the exe folder.
